#+BEGIN_NOTES
I don't think there's much to tell about myself. I've worked 8 years in
manufacturing for a local furniture manufacturer. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer; I tinker with electronics & free
software on my free time.
You can follow me through the following links. You won't find me on Facebook or
Twitter, so don't bother looking for me there.

* So, what is this Dactyl Keyboard thing?
[[file:img/brooke_baldwin.jpg]]
* Parameterized, Split-Hand, Concave, Columnar, Ergonomic Keyboard
- Written in Clojure

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Those are a lot of fancy words. What does all of that mean? Well let's look at
the project & see how it compares to a regular keyboard to answer that.
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_NOTES
First I think we need to get a better understanding of why a regular
keyboard is the way it is, so that we can understand what we're working with.

- Started March 2015
- Matt's Reasons for making the design
- Dactyl was Written in Clojure with the Help of OpenSCAD

* Let's look at a regular keyboard
- History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
- Keyboard design may be a bit antiquated

Now, before we get into this, I should state that I am not a doctor. I do know how to use Google, so I might as well be
one--but that being said--obviously, this is my understanding from my cursory
research. None of it should be construed as medical advice. Consult your doctor before
making any changes to the ergonomics of your workstations or workflow. So with
that out of the way, let's look at some things the internet tells you not to do.

- RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them

- Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
- My personal reasons

** Benefits of Ergo keyboards
#+BEGIN_NOTES
I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, other than my brain. To be
clear, I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. But, over the past
year I've just decided to make a concious effort to avoid them given my hobbies
& future plans. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as I can manage. I had the means to
build my own badass keyboard, so I did.
#+END_NOTES

* Why Would You Want That?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think that it's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy & unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard, and in
this talk I'd like to go over some of the things I've found while looking into the topic.
#+END_NOTES

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now the reason I went over the RSI examples is to demonstrate how a regular
keyboard ~postures & how the designs of these ergonomic keyboards I'm about to
show you are informed by those issues and how they ~mitigate
You can see how the design was informed to try and mitigate these things the
internet tells us not to do.
#+END_NOTES

* Notable Mentions
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The original Dactyl design is what I chose to go with, and I'll go over my
reasons for that later on. But first I'd like to quickly show everyone some
other option available & what I like and don't like about them.

- Advantages: Small, single-board form factor
- Disadvantages: Not a split design?
- Open Source: Yes
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is another keyboard I saw referenced a lot. It's a single board & not
split, but it's small (the website shows it fitting in someone's jeans pocket).
The single board design could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what
you're using it for. It's potentially less comfortable to use, but I see it
being easy to grab & go if you're using it in a mobile set-up.

This was a pull request by Joe Devivo (One of the writers of the earlier build
guides). He was attempting to add some changes to fit the Ergodox keycaps, but
the latest update to the pull was from 2017. /u/chrystalhand has apparently made
more updates to the design and is [[https://www.reddit.com/user/crystalhand/comments/96xu7g/3d_printed_dactylmanuform_cases/][trying to market it on Reddit]] and [[https://ohkeycaps.com/products/built-to-order-dactyl-manuform-keyboard][OhKeycaps.com]]. I don't know if
he's made the source available.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
In the main repository you'll find this as an option along with the 'cherry' version. The LightCycle version of
the Dactyl has fewer thumb cluster switch positions, and was designed to match with the [[http://matias.ca/switches/][Matias
ALPS-inspired mechanical keyswitches]]. The 'cherry' one is the same design, but
meant to fit with Cherry MX mechanical switches.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I think probably the best designed of all of the options I've seen. The Manuform
retains all of the features you would look for in the original, but lowers the
thumb clusters so that you hands can remain in a more natural position. Notable
hardware differences between this & the original are the use of DSA keycaps used
and the use of 2 Pro Micros for the microcontroller. I'll probably build &
switch to this in the future.

* More Do-it-Yourself Options

=There is a very nice list of other ergonomic keyboards, with pictures, on Xah Lee's website.=

* Reasons for Choosing Dactyl
- Open Source
- Kinesis Advantage form factor
- Looked like the most comfortable design
- Also looked hella cool
** My Reasons for Building by Hand Instead of Purchasing
- At the time there were none being manufactured
- Sense of self-satisfaction
- I already own a 3D printer
- Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
- One year later joke
* Build Overview
** Shell/Case & Hardware
- Time
- Apologize for lack of media
- Print process involved trial & error. Segway into 3D print & support material.
- Hardware dimensions & heating countersunk screws. Make point of heatshrink on standoffs.

** Switches & Keycaps
- Fits Cherry MX switches, explain what they are
- Go over keycap profiles
- Keycap material, count & price
** Etching
- 1:1 ratio of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide & Acid Magic (muriatic acid)
** PCB & Wiring
- The circuit design in the repo is inaccurate. I had to flip around some of
  the designs because they were backwards. I didn't find this out until after my
  first attempt at etching. Luckily I had another sheet of Pyralux that I bought
  in case I encountered those kinds of problems.
- Resistors for LEDs
**** PSA: TRRS /not/ TRS!
- Include comparison.
