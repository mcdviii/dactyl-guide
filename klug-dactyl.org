#+BEGIN_NOTES
I don't think there's much to tell about myself. I've worked 8 years in
manufacturing for a local furniture manufacturer. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer; I tinker with electronics & free
software on my free time.
You can follow me through the following links. You won't find me on Facebook or
Twitter, so don't bother looking for me there.

* So, what is this Dactyl Keyboard thing?

* Parameterized, Split-Hand, Concave, Columnar, Ergonomic Keyboard
- Written in Clojure

Those are a lot of fancy words. What does any of that mean? Well we'll get back
to that.

- Matt's Reasons for making the design
- Dactyl was Written in Clojure with the Help of OpenSCAD
** Reasons for Choosing Dactyl
- Kinesis Advantage form factor
- Open Source
- Looked like the most comfortable design
- Also looked hella cool

* Why Would You Want That?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think that it's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy & unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard, and in
this talk I'd like to go over some of the things I've found while looking into the topic.
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_NOTES
First I think we need to get a better understanding of why a regular
keyboard is the way it is, so that we can understand what we're working with.
#+END_NOTES
** Let's look at a regular keyboard
- History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
- Keyboard design may be a bit antiquated
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now, before we get into this, I should state that I am not a doctor. I do know how to use Google, so I might as well be
one--but that being said--obviously, this is my understanding from my cursory
research. None of it should be construed as medical advice. Consult your doctor before
making any changes to the ergonomics of your workstations or workflow. So with
that out of the way, let's look at some things the internet tells you not to do.
#+END_NOTES
- Compare bad hand posture to OEM keyboard
- RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them
  [[https://www.rsiprevention.com/rsi_prevention.php]]
- Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
- My personal reasons
#+BEGIN_NOTES
I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, other than my brain. To be
clear, I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. But, over the past
year I've just decided to make a concious effort to avoid them given my hobbies
& future plans. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as I can manage. I had the means to
build my own badass keyboard, so I did.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
One of the most popular ergo keyboards I've seen. It's garnered the attention &
a review from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA][Linus Tech Tips]], and has a [[https://www.ergodox.io/][long open source history]].

** [[][Atreus]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in fade-in fade-in)
- Advantages: Small, single-board form factor
- Disadvantages: Not a split design?
- Open Source: Yes
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is another keyboard I saw referenced a lot. It's a single board & not
split, but it's small (the website shows it fitting in someone's jeans pocket).
The single board design could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what
you're using it for. It's potentially less comfortable to use, but I see it
being easy to grab & go if you're using it in a mobile set-up.

Notable differences between the Signum 3 & Atreus are the thumb clusters.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This was a pull request by Joe Devivo (One of the writers of the earlier build
guides). He was attempting to add some changes to fit the Ergodox keycaps, but
the latest update to the pull was from 2017. /u/chrystalhand has apparently made
more updates to the design and is [[https://www.reddit.com/user/crystalhand/comments/96xu7g/3d_printed_dactylmanuform_cases/][trying to market it on Reddit]] and [[https://ohkeycaps.com/products/built-to-order-dactyl-manuform-keyboard][OhKeycaps.com]]. I don't know if
he's made the source available.

*** [[][Lightcycle Dactyl]]



#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in fade-in)  1 2)
- Advantages:
- Disadvantages:
- Open Source:
#+BEGIN_NOTES
In the main repository you'll find this as an option along with the 'cherry' version. The LightCycle version of
the Dactyl has fewer thumb cluster switch positions, and was designed to match with the [[http://matias.ca/switches/][Matias
ALPS-inspired mechanical keyswitches]]. The 'cherry' one is the same design, but
meant to fit with Cherry MX mechanical switches.
#+END_NOTES

*** [[Dactyl Manuform][]]



- Advantages:
- Disadvantages:
- Open Source:
#+BEGIN_NOTES
I think probably the best designed of all of the options I've seen. The Manuform
retains all of the features you would look for in the original, but lowers the
thumb clusters so that you hands can remain in a more natural position. Notable
hardware differences between this & the original are the use of DSA keycaps used
and the use of 2 Pro Micros for the microcontroller. I'll probably build &
switch to this in the future.

* Dactyl Project
** My Reasons for Building by Hand Instead of Purchasing
- At the time there were none being manufactured
- Sense of self-satisfaction
- I already own a 3D printer
- Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
- One year later joke
** Build Overview
*** Shell/Case
*** Switches & Keycaps
*** Hardware
*** Etching
- 1:1 ratio of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide & Acid Magic (muriatic acid)
*** PCB & Wiring
- The curcuit desigt in the repo is inaccurate. I had to flip around some of
  the designs because they were backwards. I didn't find this out until after my
  first attempt at etching. Luckily I had another sheet of Pyralux that I bought
  in case I encountered those kinds of problems.
*** Firmware
*** How Does it Work?
- Explain matrix positions
*** Challenges
- Hardware, clearance & dimentions
- PCB etching (I probably went the most expensive route.)
- Which way to wire the diodes
- How the keyboard is controlled by the MC (key matrix)
