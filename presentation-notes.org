- I work in manufacturing as a machine operator for a local furniture
  manufacturer.
- I tinker with electronics & free software on my free time.

** Benefits of Ergo keyboards
*** Why would you want or need this?
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question:
"Why would you need/want that."
It seems like a fair question. I imagine in the eyes of an uninitiated it would
seem like RGB lighting on a personal computer: expensive, showy & unnecessary.
But I would argue there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard.
**** My personal reasons
***** I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, aside from what's floating around in my skull.
**** History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
**** Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
***** Only a normie would use an OEM keyboard!
*** RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them

*** My Reasons for Building by Hand Instead of Purchasing
- At the time there were none being manufactured
- Nerd cred
- Sense of self-satisfaction
- Building my own helps me to improve the project by contributing personal
  improvements back (Open Source)
- I already own a 3D printer
- Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
- One year later joke
