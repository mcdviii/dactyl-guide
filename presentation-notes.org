* Why would you want or need this?
** Benefits of Ergo keyboards
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question:
"Why would you need/want that."
It seems like a fair question. I imagine in the eyes of an uninitiated it would
seem like RGB lighting on a personal computer: expensive, showy & unnecessary.
But I would argue there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard.
*** My personal reasons
**** I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, aside from what's floating around in my skull.
*** History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
*** Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
**** Only a normie would use an OEM keyboard!
** RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them
- I am not a doctor! I just searched causes for RSI issues! Don't shoot me!
*** Ulnar deviation
