* Why would you want or need this?
** Benefits of Ergo keyboards
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question:
"Why would you need/want that."
It seems like a fair question. I imagine in the eyes of an uninitiated it would
seem like RGB lighting on a personal computer: expensive, showy & unnecessary.
But I would argue there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard.
** Let's look at a regular keyboard
- History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
- RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them
- I am not a doctor! I just searched causes for RSI issues! Don't shoot me!
- Compare bad hand posture to OEM keyboard
- Ulnar deviation
- Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
- My personal reasons
- I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, aside from what's floating around in my skull.

  improvements back (Open Source)
- I already own a 3D printer
- Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
- One year later joke
