I recently gave a talk at my local Linux User Group about my experience building
 a Dactyl ergonomic keyboard; along with my reasons for doing so. The notes for
 that talk follow. You will find a downloadable PDF version of the notes at the
 bottom of the page.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I've worked 8 years in manufacturing. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator for a local furniture
  manufacturer.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer.
I tinker with electronics & free software on my free time, because being social is for normies.

* So, vhat is this Dactyl Keyboard thing?
[[file:img/funnydance.gif]]
- Columnar, Ortholinear, written in Clojure
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Those are a lot of fancy words. What does any of that mean? Well we'll get back
to that.
#+END_NOTES

** History or Background
- Matt's Clojurcon Youtube Video
- Matt's Reasons for making the design
- Dactyl was Written in Clojure with the Help of OpenSCAD
** Reasons for Choosing Dactyl
- Kinesis Advantage form factor
- Open Source
- Looked like the most comfortable design
- Also looked hella cool
* Why Would You Want That?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think that it's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy & unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard, and in
this talk I'd like to go over some of the things I've found while looking into the topic.
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_NOTES
First I think we need to get a better understanding of why a regular
keyboard is the way it is, so that we can understand what we're working with.
#+END_NOTES
** Let's look at a regular keyboard
- History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
- Keyboard design may be a bit antiquated
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now, before we get into this, I should state that I am not a doctor. I do know how to use Google, so I might as well be
one--but that being said--obviously, this is my understanding from my cursory
research. None of it should be construed as medical advice. Consult your doctor before
making any changes to the ergonomics of your workstations or workflow. So with
that out of the way, let's look at some things the internet tells you not to do.
#+END_NOTES
- Compare bad hand posture to OEM keyboard
- RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them
  [[https://www.rsiprevention.com/rsi_prevention.php]]
- Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
- My personal reasons
#+BEGIN_NOTES
I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, other than my brain. To be
clear, I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. But, over the past
year I've just decided to make a concious effort to avoid them given my hobbies
& future plans. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as I can manage. I had the means to
build my own badass keyboard, so I did.

** Atreus

[[file:img/Atreus.jpg]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in fade-in fade-in)
- Advantages: Small, single-board form factor
- Disadvantages: Not a split design?
- Open Source: Yes
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is another keyboard I saw referenced a lot. It's a single board & not
split, but it's small (the website shows it fitting in someone's jeans pocket).
The single board design could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what
you're using it for. It's potentially less comfortable to use, but I see it
being easy to grab & go if you're using it in a mobile set-up.
#+END_NOTES

** Signum 3 (Troy Fletcher)

[[file:img/Signum3.0.jpg]]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in fade-in fade-in)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Notable differences between the Signum 3 & Atreus are the thumb clusters.

* Dactyl Project
** My Reasons for Building by Hand Instead of Purchasing
- At the time there were none being manufactured
- Sense of self-satisfaction
- Building my own helps me to improve the project by contributing personal
  improvements back (Open Source)
- I already own a 3D printer
- Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
- One year later joke
** Build Overview
*** Shell/Case
*** Switches & Keycaps
*** Hardware
*** PCB & Wiring
*** Firmware
*** How Does it Work?
- Explain matrix positions
*** Challenges
- Which way to wire the diodes
- How the keyboard is controlled by the MC (key matrix)
