I don't think there's much to tell about myself. I've worked 8 years in
manufacturing for a local furniture manufacturer. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer; I tinker with electronics &amp; free
software on my free time.
You can follow me through the following links. You won't find me on Facebook or

Those are a lot of fancy words. What does all of that mean? Well let's look at
the project &amp; see how it compares to a regular keyboard to answer that.

Now, before we get into this, I should state that I am not a doctor. I do know how to use Google, so I might as well be
one&#x2013;but that being said&#x2013;obviously, this is my understanding from my cursory
research. None of it should be construed as medical advice. Consult your doctor before
making any changes to the ergonomics of your workstations or workflow. So with
that out of the way, let's look at some things the internet tells you not to do.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, other than my brain. To be
clear, I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. But, over the past
year I've just decided to make a concious effort to avoid them given my hobbies
&amp; future plans. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as I can manage. I had the means to
build my own badass keyboard, so I did.

<h2 id="org1c7907e">Why Would You Want That?</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think that it's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy &amp; unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard, and in
this talk I'd like to go over some of the things I've found while looking into the topic.
</p>

</aside>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the reason I went over the RSI examples is to demonstrate how a regular
keyboard ~postures &amp; how the designs of these ergonomic keyboards I'm about to
show you are informed by those issues and how they ~mitigate
You can see how the design was informed to try and mitigate these things the
internet tells us not to do.

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
As I first started really focusing on learning tools like bash &amp; emacs, I
started hearing allusions to RSI, &amp; more than a few references to this keyboard.
It's probably the best commercial ergo keyboard you can get, but it comes at a
price. Also, I think it was a review by Linus Tech Tips where he describes the
feel of the plastic being light &amp; inexpensive. Not something you want to hear
when you drop over $300 on something exclusively commercial.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
One of the most popular ergo keyboards I've seen. It's garnered the attention &amp;
a review from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA">Linus Tech Tips</a>, and has a <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">long open source history</a>. As far as I
can tell, the Ergodox project really kickstarted the idea of open source
keyboard hardware. You see references to it everywhere, and its popularity on
the ergo keyboard space is unavoidable. If you go the DIY route, you can find blank PCBs somewhat
readily, and the rest of the parts can be easily sourced yourself.

<li class="fragment fade-in">Disadvantages: Not concave</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Open Source: Yes</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
This was my first introduction to the idea of an open source keyboard. I was
browsing thingiverse (A place where people share their 3D print designs), and
someone had shared a brakcket they used to attach this keyboard to their laptop.
I remembered that, and after looking at the previou Kinesis keyboard, I wondered
if anyone had started a project similar to that design, but open source &amp; with a
split form factor. Someone had, and that's why I'm here.

<ul>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Advantages: Small, single-board form factor</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Disadvantages: Not a split design?</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Open Source: Yes</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is another keyboard I saw referenced a lot. It's a single board &amp; not
split, but it's small (the website shows it fitting in someone's jeans pocket).
The single board design could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what
you're using it for. It's potentially less comfortable to use, but I see it
being easy to grab &amp; go if you're using it in a mobile set-up.

<ul>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Advantages: Very simple design (solder on components, nothing else to worry about)</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Disadvantages: PCB is $80, no case for protection</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Open Source: Yes?</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The guy who makes this is a freelance programmer based in Kentucky. He has a
youtube channel that's pretty interesting if you're into vlogs. The notable
differences between this &amp; Atreus on the previous slide are the thumb cluster
positions and the exposed PCB. It does look like the entire board is covered
with a solder mask, but it won't be as protected if dropped. It looks like there
is a repo made for this on github, but there's not much in it. You may need to
contact the author for product designs if you need them.

This was a pull request by Joe Devivo (One of the writers of the earlier build
guides). He was attempting to add some changes to fit the Ergodox keycaps, but
the latest update to the pull was from 2017. /u/chrystalhand has apparently made
more updates to the design and is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crystalhand/comments/96xu7g/3d_printed_dactylmanuform_cases/">trying to market it on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://ohkeycaps.com/products/built-to-order-dactyl-manuform-keyboard">OhKeycaps.com</a>. I don't know if

<ul>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Advantages: Slightly smaller footprint (fewer keys)</li>

<li class="fragment fade-in">Open Source: Yes</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
In the main repository you'll find this as an option along with the 'cherry'
option for the same version. The LightCycle version of the Dactyl has fewer
thumb cluster switch positions and one less row of keys It was originally designed to match with the <a href="http://matias.ca/switches/">Matias
ALPS-inspired mechanical keyswitches</a>. The 'cherry' version of this is the same
design, but are meant to be fit with Cherry MX mechanical switches.

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/Dactyl Manuform.jpg" alt="Dactyl Manuform.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Advantages: Thumb clusters are brought down to a more natural position, Case
is larger making wiring less tedious</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Disadvantages: Must be wired by hand, all of the challenges that come with
original Dactyl</li>
<li class="fragment fade-in">Open Source: Yes</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
I think probably the best designed of all of the options I've seen. The Manuform
retains all of the features you would look for in the original, but lowers the
thumb clusters so that you hands can remain in a more natural position. Notable
hardware differences between this &amp; the original are the use of DSA keycaps used
and the use of 2 Pro Micros for the microcontroller. I'll probably build &amp;
switch to this in the future.
