I don't think there's much to tell about myself. I've worked 8 years in
manufacturing for a local furniture manufacturer. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer; I tinker with electronics &amp; free
software on my free time.
You can follow me through the following links. You won't find me on Facebook or

Those are a lot of fancy words. What does all of that mean? Well we'll look at
the project &amp; see how it compares to a regular keyboard to answer that. But
first I'll talk a little bit about the project.

<li>Written in Clojure by using a wrapper arond OpenSCAD</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The Dactyl project was originally started in 2015 by a guy named Matt Adereth. I
haven't seen what his motivations for starting this were, but I would guess you
could find some clues to that on his Twitter page. There are some obvious
similarities between this and another keyboard commercially available that I'll
show later on, and I think he drew inspiration &amp; motivation from that.
</p>

<p>
If you're wondering what it means, dactyl means finger, toe or digit.
</p>

<p>
The really interesting thing about this project is that the mesh was written in Lisp. If
you're not familiar with OpenSCAD, it's free software which interprets functions
and creates geometry from that. Obviously it uses a lot of math &amp; complex
geometry for more complex objects. Matt didn't like the language that OpenSCAD
used, but was able to serindipitously find a wrapper to go around the program that would
interpret Clojure and convert it into the language that OpenSCAD understands.

<h2 id="org71b3752">Where is the Project Now?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Last commit was in 2017</li>
<li>Left in unfinished state &amp; appears to be abandoned</li>
<li>Documentation is left unfinished</li>
<li>OpenSCAD functions don't stay consistant between versions or otherwise
play nice with lisp wrapper.</li>
<li>Most challenging build to take on</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the repository appears to be abandoned since 2017. There are some pull
requests left open, and the physical build documentation has been only partly provided by
community members. Once you understand the basics of how the electronics work, it's
not too complicated, but it reqiures quite a bit of research from dispirate
sources.
</p>

<p>
The documentation for setting up the workflow to be fairly complete, but changes
between versions of OpenSCAD seem to break significant functionality and make
using the workflow with the wrapper difficult. Many of the meshes other than the
standard one currently have holes in them because of these issues.
</p>

<p>
Because of all of these reasons, and the shape of the keyboard &amp; minimal
internal clearance for components, in my opinion this is probably one of the
most challenging DIY keyboard projects you could take on.

<h2 id="org8749d9a">Why Tho?</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
During my research into this other ergo keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think that it's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy &amp; unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard,
and befor I go any further into my build I'd like to justify myself in the eye
of reason.
</p>

</aside>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Before I do that, I should state that I am not a doctor. I do know how to use Google, so I might as well be
one&#x2013;but obviously, this is my understanding from my cursory
research. It's not medical advice. Consult your doctor before
making any changes to the ergonomics of your workstations.
Also, I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. I'm just a guy who thought
building my own keyboard would be both a fun &amp; educational project, with a very
practical benefit of protecting myself from injury in the future. I take the
usefulness of my hands pretty seriously &amp; I want to be proactive with protecting myself from any
unnecessary harm.

<h2 id="org47b6040">So, let's look at a regular keyboard</h2>

<ul>
<li>Single board is cost effective &amp; efficient, but can encourage unhealthy posture</li>
<li>Offset rows are holdovers from typwriters</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So this is a regular keyboard, or what would be a regular keyboard if it were an
actual image of one. The two things I want to point out here is the width of the design
&amp; the offset rows. The offset rows are holdovers from the days of typewriters.
The letters were offset like that to allow for the armatures to clear each other
when striking the paper. In terms of repetetive strain injury, this is
unnecessary &amp; bad, because with today's application this no longer serves any practical
purpose, and it's bad becaus you're reaching for those keys that could
otherwise be set in a straght vertical column, which would reduce the amount of
reaching you need to do while typing. It might not seem like much, but the
repetition of an unnecessary movement will probably contribute to the risk of
RSI. After looking at the other options available I just think this is a bad,
outdated design.

<h2 id="org7282582">What is RSI?</h2>

</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Keep your hands flat and straight out from your shoulders (neutral position)</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
But, over the past year I've just decided to make a concious effort to avoid them given my hobbies
&amp; future plans. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as I can manage. I had the means to
build my own badass keyboard, so I did.
If your careers or hobbies depend on your ability to type, it
would arguably be wise to foster that capability &amp; invest at least some time
into developing healther habits, before it's too late.
</p>

</aside>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The reason I went over the RSI examples is to demonstrate how a regular
keyboard encourages a certain posture, and hopefully you can see how the designs of these other ergonomic keyboards I'm about to
show you are informed by those issues, and maybe you can see how they attempt to
mitigate some of the bad habits one might form while typing through better
design. Most of these are other open source ergo keyboards that you can build yourself.

So the original Dactyl design is what I chose to go with, and I'll go over my
reasons for that later on. But first I'd like to quickly show everyone some

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
As I first started really focusing on learning tools like bash &amp; emacs, I
started hearing allusions to RSI, &amp; more than a few references to this keyboard.
It's probably the best commercial ergo keyboard you can get, but it comes at a
price. Also, I think it was a review by Linus Tech Tips where he describes the
feel of the plastic being light &amp; inexpensive. Not something you want to hear
when you drop over $300 on something exclusively commercial.

<p>
One of the most popular ergo keyboards I've seen. It's garnered the attention &amp;
a review from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA">Linus Tech Tips</a>, and has a <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">long open source history</a>. As far as I
can tell, the Ergodox project kickstarted the idea of open source
keyboard hardware. You see references to it everywhere, and its popularity on
the ergo keyboard space is unavoidable. Almost any split, open hardware design
available has borrowed something from the ErgoDox. If you go the DIY route, you can find blank PCBs somewhat
readily, and the rest of the parts can be easily sourced yourself.

<p>
This was my first introduction to the idea of an open source keyboard. I was
browsing thingiverse (A place where people share their 3D print designs), and
someone had shared a brakcket they used to attach this keyboard to their laptop.
I remembered that, and after looking at the previou Kinesis keyboard, I wondered
if anyone had started a project similar to that design, but open source &amp; with a
split form factor. Someone had, and that's why I'm here.

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is another keyboard I saw referenced a lot. It's a single board &amp; not
split, but it's small (the website shows it fitting in someone's jeans pocket).
The single board design could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what
you're using it for. It's potentially less comfortable to use, but I see it
being easy to grab &amp; go if you're using it in a mobile set-up.

<p>
The guy who makes this is a freelance programmer based in Kentucky. He has a
youtube channel that's pretty interesting if you're into vlogs. The notable
differences between this &amp; Atreus on the previous slide are the thumb cluster
positions and the exposed PCB. It does look like the entire board is covered
with a solder mask, but it won't be as protected if dropped. It looks like there
is a repo made for this on github, but there's not much in it. You may need to
contact the author for product designs if you need them.

This was a pull request by Joe Devivo (One of the writers of the earlier build

the latest update to the pull was from 2017. /u/chrystalhand has apparently made
more updates to the design and is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crystalhand/comments/96xu7g/3d_printed_dactylmanuform_cases/">trying to market it on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://ohkeycaps.com/products/built-to-order-dactyl-manuform-keyboard">OhKeycaps.com</a>. I don't know if

In the main repository you'll find this as an option along with the 'cherry'
option for the same version. The LightCycle version of the Dactyl has fewer
thumb cluster switch positions and one less row of keys It was originally designed to match with the <a href="http://matias.ca/switches/">Matias

<p>
I think probably the best designed of all of the options I've seen. The Manuform
retains all of the features you would look for in the original, but lowers the
thumb clusters so that you hands can remain in a more natural position. Notable
hardware differences between this &amp; the original are the use of DSA keycaps used
and the use of 2 Pro Micros for the microcontroller. I'll probably build &amp;
switch to this in the future.
