I don't think there's much to tell about myself. I've worked 8 years in
manufacturing for a local furniture manufacturer. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer; I tinker with electronics &amp; free
software on my free time.
You can follow me through the following links. You won't find me on Facebook or
Twitter, so don't bother looking for me there.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The Dactyl project was originally started in 2015 by a guy named Matt Adereth. I
haven't seen what his motivations for starting this were, but I would guess you
could find some clues to that on his Twitter page. There are some obvious
similarities between this and another keyboard commercially available that I'll
show later on, and I think he drew inspiration &amp; motivation from that.
</p>

<p>
If you're wondering what dactyl means, it's defined by the <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/dactyl">freeonlindictionary</a>
as: finger, toe or digit.
</p>

<p>
The really interesting thing about this project is that the mesh was written in Lisp. If
you're not familiar with OpenSCAD, it's free software which interprets functions
and creates geometry from that. Obviously it uses a lot of math &amp; complex
geometry for more complex objects. Matt didn't like the language that OpenSCAD
used, but was able to serindipitously find a wrapper to go around the program that would
interpret Clojure and convert it into the language that OpenSCAD understands.

<li>One of the most challenging DIY keyboard builds to take on</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So the repository appears to be abandoned since 2017. There are some pull
requests left open, and the physical build documentation has been only partly provided by
community members. Once you understand the basics of how the electronics work, it's
not too complicated, but it reqiures quite a bit of research from dispirate
sources.
</p>

<p>
The documentation for setting up the workflow to be fairly complete, but changes
between versions of OpenSCAD seem to break significant functionality and make
using the workflow with the wrapper difficult. Many of the meshes other than the
standard one currently have holes in them because of these issues.
</p>

<p>
Because of all of these reasons, and the shape of the keyboard &amp; minimal
internal clearance for components, in my opinion this is probably one of the
most challenging DIY keyboard projects you could take on.

<li class="fragment fade-in">In short, because I can.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
During my research into this other ergo keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think that it's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy &amp; unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard,
and before I go any further into my build I'd like to justify myself in the eye
of reason.
I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. I'm just a guy who thought
building my own keyboard would be both a fun &amp; educational project, with a very
practical benefit of protecting myself from injury in the future. I take the
usefulness of my hands pretty seriously &amp; I want to be proactive with protecting myself from any
unnecessary risks. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as possible. I had the means to
build my own badass keyboard, so I did.

<ul>
<li>Single board is cost effective &amp; efficient, but can encourage unhealthy posture</li>
<li>Offset rows are holdovers from typwriters</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So this is a regular keyboard, or what would be a regular keyboard if it were an
actual image of one. The two things I want to point out here is the width of the design
&amp; the offset rows. The offset rows are holdovers from the days of typewriters.
The letters were offset like that to allow for the armatures to clear each other
when striking the paper. In terms of repetetive strain injury, this is
unnecessary &amp; bad, because with today's application this no longer serves any practical
purpose, and it's bad because you're reaching for those keys that could
be closer to your fingers by being placed in a straght vertical column, which would reduce the amount of
reaching you would need to do while typing. It might not seem like much, but the
repetition of an unnecessary movement will probably contribute to the risk of
RSI. After looking at the other options available I just think this is a bad,
outdated design.
If your careers or hobbies depend on your ability to type, it
would arguably be a good idea to at least invest some time
into developing healther habits, before it's too late. For me, I thought a good
ergo keyboard design could help me to do that.

<p>
The reason I've included this is to demonstrate how a regular
keyboard can encourage a certain posture, and hopefully you can see how the designs of these other ergonomic keyboards I'm about to
show you are informed by these issues. I think you'll see how they attempt to
mitigate some of these habits through better design.
Most of these are other open source keyboards that you can build yourself.

<p>
As I first started really focusing on learning tools like bash &amp; emacs, I
started hearing allusions to RSI, &amp; more than a few references to this keyboard.
It's probably the best commercial ergo keyboard you can get, but it comes at a
price. Also, I think it was a review by Linus Tech Tips where he describes the
feel of the plastic being light &amp; inexpensive. Not something you want to hear
when you drop over $300 on something exclusively commercial.

<p>
One of the most popular ergo keyboards I've seen. It's garnered the attention &amp;
a review from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LALQsqZP1nA">Linus Tech Tips</a>, and has a <a href="https://www.ergodox.io/">long open source history</a>. As far as I
can tell, the Ergodox project kickstarted the idea of open source
keyboard hardware. You see references to it everywhere, and its popularity on
the ergo keyboard space is unavoidable. Almost any split, open hardware design
available has borrowed something from the ErgoDox. If you go the DIY route, you can find blank PCBs somewhat
readily, and the rest of the parts can be easily sourced yourself.

<p>
This was my first introduction to the idea of an open source keyboard. I was
browsing thingiverse (A place where people share their 3D print designs), and
someone had shared a brakcket they used to attach this keyboard to their laptop.
I remembered that, and after looking at the previou Kinesis keyboard, I wondered
if anyone had started a project similar to that design, but open source &amp; with a
split form factor. Someone had, and that's why I'm here.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is another keyboard I saw referenced a lot. It's a single board &amp; not
split, but it's small (the website shows it fitting in someone's jeans pocket).
The single board design could be an advantage or disadvantage depending on what
you're using it for. It's potentially less comfortable to use, but I see it
being easy to grab &amp; go if you're using it in a mobile set-up.

The guy who makes this is a freelance programmer based in Kentucky. He has a
youtube channel that's pretty interesting if you're into vlogs. The notable
differences between this &amp; Atreus on the previous slide are the thumb cluster
positions and the exposed PCB. It does look like the entire board is covered
with a solder mask, but it won't be as protected if dropped. It looks like there
is a repo made for this on github, but there's not much in it. You may need to
contact the author for product designs if you need them.

This was a pull request by Joe Devivo (One of the writers of the earlier build

In the main repository you'll find this as an option along with the 'cherry'
option for the same version. The LightCycle version of the Dactyl has fewer
thumb cluster switch positions and one less row of keys It was originally designed to match with the <a href="http://matias.ca/switches/">Matias

I think probably the best designed of all of the options I've seen. The Manuform
retains all of the features you would look for in the original, but lowers the
thumb clusters so that you hands can remain in a more natural position. Notable
hardware differences between this &amp; the original are the use of DSA keycaps used
and the use of 2 Pro Micros for the microcontroller. I'll probably build &amp;
switch to this in the future.

The body of the keyboard is 3D printed in PLA with infused with wood fibers, so
at some point I want to try and stain it. There is a top and bottom to each
half, and each top and bottom piece took 21 hours each to print. My main
challenge here was finding the correct amount of support material to use. For a
slicer I used Slic3r, and your options for support material are somewhat
limited. In my first attempt I used too high of a resolution and the support was
so fine that it was impossible to separate from the print. My second attempt was
the bottom left half and I think it turned out pretty good.

For hardware connecting the halves, there was no documentation for it so I
referenced some build videos on YouTube and dug through my collection of
computer hardware &amp; screws and found that 3mm female motherboard standoffs that
were 6mm tall worked great with these 3mm countersunk screws. I took a soldering
iron and heated the screws up while pushing them into the hole in the plastic to
create a countersink. Without that countersink there would be clearance issues
with keycaps, so the keycaps would hit the head of the screw when pressed down.
I also added some 1/8" heatshrink tubing to the standoffs so that they wouldn't
cause any shorts with the wiring.

<p>
So Cherry MX is the most popular switch manufacturer on the market. Most
mechanical keyboards use Cherry MX for key switches. There are several different
models available which range from linear to tactile feel, quiet to noisy &amp;
clicky. I have 9 different ones to choose from here if anyone wants to test them
out. There are knockoffs available on the market as well. Gaterons are a notable
example (just be aware that colors/models differ between the two manufacturers).

If you look at your OEM keyboard from the side, you'll notice a curve to the
tops of the keys. The bottom row of keys also hav a different shape compared to
the top row. This is called the keycap profile. SA is what's recommended for the
standard Dactyl and what I've used in my build. DSA is what's recommended for
the manuform.
A quick note on keycap material: You'll see two main types of materials
referenced when shopping for keycaps. ABS &amp; PBT. ABS is cheaper, but fades over
time. PBT is known for holding up better but is obviously more expensive for
that reason.

<p>
Oh boy. So to start with, I've combined both the left-hand &amp; right-hand PCB
designs onto one sheet to save on material. The way this works is there's
something called Pyralux you can get that is basically a thin sheet of copper
with a kapton tape backing. This is what I've used for mine. We'll get into the
etching later.
Another thing I'll note about the PCB designs in the original repo is that
some of the pieces are flipped the wrong way around, and for some reason
they weren't consistantly flipped. I found this out after my first etching
attempt and I had cut out all of the individual pieces and was trying to apply
them to be soldered.
If you were using the toner tranfer method, where you would use a laser printer
and iron the paper onto your workpiece to leave a toner deposit in the shape of
your circuit, it would make sense to mirror the entire design, but some pieces were flipped one way while others
were correctly oriented. I searched imgur.com for completed builds and was able

In many tutorials, you'll read references to printing circuit designs onto
Pyralux with toner laser printers at Kinkos. This is incorrect. What they're
actually referring to are solid ink printers manufactured by Xerox. These
commercial printers use a type of wax for ink, and are actually kind of hard to
come by. I was able to find a used one on Craigslist that was having paper
jamming issues that I picked up for $50 from a guy in Rogers, MN. I found an
official service manual on manualslib.com &amp; pinpointed the offending sensors for the
paper jamming issue and replaced them with parts sourced from ebay.

To prepare the copper I scuffed the surface of the copper &amp; rubbed it down with
90% Isoprpyl Alcohol. I also had to use double sided tape to center the Pyralux
sheet at the top of a piece of card stock, so that the printer would recognize
the sheet as a normal 8 1/2" X 11" piece of paper. The last thing I did was
change the print settings on the printer to 'Transparency' so that the printer
would apply enough wax to hold the design together.

For etching I used about 1:1 ratio of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide &amp; Acid Magic
(Marketed as 'safer' Muriatic Acid, found on Amazon.). This seemed to be the
safest and most accessable option over ferric chloride. You can reuse the
solution by monitoring the amounts of each ratio in the solution, but you need
to be very careful about it because you might end up creating chlorine gas.
</p>

<p>
Make sure to 'add the acid', you can see the copper lifting here, you'll notice
the color of solution turning green with copper at this point, here you see the Kapton tape
backing and some remaining copper, after you're done you should put the sheet in
a water bath to stop the acidic reaction and clean any off any residues left
from the precess. I chose to sand off the wax with 220 grit sandpaper because it
was mixing with the solder and I got annoyed by it. You probably want some kind
of coating over the copper to prevent corrosion.

So there are two ways in which you can wire up your key matrix, which are
row-driven &amp; column-driven. A row-driven matrix is one where current travels
from the microcontroller, through the switch &amp; diode &amp; then back into the MC via
the column. A column-driven matrix is the inverse.
While wiring the key matrix, one big challenge was trying to figure out the orientation of the diodes.
If you're not familiar with what a diode is, it basically works to only allow
current to flow in one direction. The way they're used here is to insure that
the input and output sent and recieved by the microcontroller only flows in one
direction.
The orientation of the diodes is entirely dependent on how you wire your rows &amp;
columns and whether you choose to send output through the switch from the rows
or the columns. In my case I went with a row-driven matrix, as that seems to be most common, and I
read allusions to it being a more efficient option in the QMK firmware. With
that decided, I wired the Cathode, or negative end with the stripe facing away
from the switch pin on the column.
As long as all the diodes are consistantly wired, it really shouldn't matter how
you wire your matrix. You can easily flip it in the QMK firmware.
I should also point out there is a discrepency in pin position for some of rows between the photos I used for referencing the PCB
design and the wiring diagram shown in the guide in the repo. I attribute this
to updates in the QMK firmware, but I don't know. It's something to be aware of.

<h3 id="org363f467">Notes on LEDs</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Oh boy. One challenge I faced was how to choose resistors to match up with the
LEDs, and what size LEDs to buy. LEDs need resistors paired with them so that
they draw a steady current and don't become overloaded. You won't likely be able
to find the current draw unless you purchase them with a documented current
draw. I got mine from Digikey.com. I used on online calculator to calculate the
correct resistance, but the formula is pretty simple. R=I/V. Almost all USB hubs
are going to power your devices at 5V DC, so if you take the current rating for
your LED and devide it by 5V you should get the resistance value needed for your
LED.
I wanted the LEDs to fit into the slot provided by the key switch, so I looked
it up and the T-1 LED form factor is what you want to use. This is also the type
of LED you would use to backlight your keycaps.

<p>
So when I ran my first tests after completing the wiring ane firmware, OSX kept
complaining about the USB device drawing too much current. It was selfishly
holding power to the USB hub hostage until I unplugged the device. This is why.
This is the cable that connects the two halves together so the MC can
communicate with the left half. The letters TRS stand for Tip, Ring &amp; Sleeve.
The documentation calls for a TRRS cable. Originally I mistook it for a basic
3.5mm stereo audio connector, but as you can see it doesn't have the necessary
contact points and was causing a short inside the input jacks. The way I solved
this on short notice was by running to Menards and buying 2 sets of cheap
earbuds with microphones built in, cutting off the earbud half ande soldering
the 2 ends together.I'm still not getting input from the left half, but I think
that's more likely due to a short in the right half that I still need to diagnose.

So I have a spare Teensy 2.0 here, and I think instead of describing the
flashing process I'll just show you.
I'll be loading QMK firmware onto this. It's the most popular and widely
supported keyboard firmware available that I've found at least. They have a huge
list of hardware that the project supports.
