<div class="NOTES">
I've worked 8 years in manufacturing. About 6 of those years I've worked as a machine operator for a local furniture
  manufacturer.
I own a reasonably sized 3D printer.
I tinker with electronics & free software on my free time, because being social is for normies.

# What is the Dactyl Keyboard?

-   Columnar, Ortholinear, written in Clojure

<div class="NOTES">
Those are a lot of fancy words. What does any of that mean? Well we'll get back
to that.

</div>


## History or Background


### Matt's Clojurcon Youtube Video


### Matt's Reasons for making the design


### Dactyl was Written in Clojure with the Help of OpenSCAD


## Reasons for Choosing Dactyl

-   Kinesis Advantage form factor
-   Open Source
-   Looked like the most comfortable design
-   Also looked hella cool


# Why Would You Want That?

<div class="NOTES">
While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question: "Why would you need/want that.", and I think tt's a fair question.
It smacks of iPhone ownership or RGB lighting: Do you really need that? To the
outside observer it might look like an expensive, showy & unnecessary gadget.
But I think there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard, and in
this talk I'd like to go over what I've found while looking into this topic.
Now to be clear, I don't experience RSI issues, nor have I ever. Over the past
year I've just decided to make a concious effort to avoid them given my hobbies
& future plans. I use a computer a lot, and I would like to continue using a
computer a lot with as few negative affects as I can manage.

</div>

<div class="NOTES">
First I think we need to get a better understanding of what a regular
keyboard is, so that we can understand what we're working with.

</div>


## Let's look at a regular keyboard

-   History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth

<div class="NOTES">
Now, I am not a doctor. But I do know how to use Google, so I might as well be
one. That being said, obviously this is my understanding from my research, and
none of it should be construed as medical advice.

</div>

-   RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them
-   Compare bad hand posture to OEM keyboard
-   Ulnar deviation
-   Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
-   My personal reasons

<div class="NOTES">
I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, other than my brain.

# Dactyl Project


## My Reasons for Building by Hand Instead of Purchasing

-   At the time there were none being manufactured
-   Sense of self-satisfaction
-   Building my own helps me to improve the project by contributing personal
    improvements back (Open Source)
-   I already own a 3D printer
-   Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
-   One year later joke


## Build Overview


### Shell/Case


### Switches & Keycaps


### Hardware


### PCB & Wiring


### Firmware


### How Does it Work?

-   Explain matrix positions


### Challenges

-   Which way to wire the diodes
-   How the keyboard is controlled by the MC (key matrix)
