## Benefits of Ergo keyboards


<a id="orgf40ed1d"></a>

### Why would you want or need this?

While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question:
"Why would you need/want that."
It seems like a fair question. I imagine in the eyes of an uninitiated it would
seem like RGB lighting on a personal computer: expensive, showy & unnecessary.
But I would argue there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard.

1.  My personal reasons

    1.  I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, aside from what's floating around in my skull.

2.  History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth

3.  Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)

    1.  Only a normie would use an OEM keyboard!

### My Reasons for Building by Hand Instead of Purchasing

-   At the time there were none being manufactured
-   Sense of self-satisfaction
-   Building my own helps me to improve the project by contributing personal
    improvements back (Open Source)
-   I already own a 3D printer
-   Screw paying someone else >$300, I'll just build my own!
-   One year later joke
