# Why would you want or need this?


## Benefits of Ergo keyboards

While browsing around looking at these ergonomic keyboards I see a recurring
question:
"Why would you need/want that."
It seems like a fair question. I imagine in the eyes of an uninitiated it would
seem like RGB lighting on a personal computer: expensive, showy & unnecessary.
But I would argue there are real health benefits to using a proper ergonomic keyboard.


## Let's look at a regular keyboard

-   History of Typwriter According to Matt Addereth
-   RSI Injuries & How to Avoid Them
-   I am not a doctor! I just searched causes for RSI issues! Don't shoot me!
-   Compare bad hand posture to OEM keyboard
-   Ulnar deviation
-   Other relatable reasons (Programmers, emacs pinky)
-   My personal reasons
-   I consider my hands to be my greatest physical asset, aside from what's floating around in my skull.
